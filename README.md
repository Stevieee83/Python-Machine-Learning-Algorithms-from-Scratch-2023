# Python-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-from-Scratch-2023

The repository includes several machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python. The algorithms are for educational purposes only, where code comments have been included throughout Jupyter Notebooks and Python .py files to explain the operation of the source code.

The Jupyter Notebook source code is easier to understand than the .py Python scripts where object-orientated programming has been used. It is recommended that if you are new to Python, try to understand the Jupyuter Notebook versions of the algorithm in the first instance before moving on to the .py Python files. The .py Python files require experience with the object-oriented programming paradigm at a beginner's level.

The requirements.txt file has been included for each machine learning algorithm. Using the requirements.txt will ensure that the version of the Python package used to write the software is installed in the event any of the libraries have been altered by the developers responsible for them.
